We use data from the World Bank Development Indicators database for the period 1990\textendash 2017. We initially use a large panel of 105 developing countries. Subsequently we study a panel with the sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries since this region is one of the poorest regions in the world. We estimate cross-country and panel regressions. The results suggest that gender equality in education contributes to economic growth and this is a common feature in developing countries. The contribution of equality in education to growth seems to be greater in the SSA countries than in the entire sample of developing countries. The female\textendash male ratio of labour market participation is not statistically significant. We also find a significant link between the presence of women in parliaments and growth in the sample of all developing countries, while this relationship is negative for the SSA countries. It is likely that despite the increased participation of women in the political arena in these countries, women may still encounter major obstacles to altering political priorities and affecting economic growth.},

Results show large negative effects acrossmany dimensions. Due to COVID-19: 13\% of students have delayed graduation, 40\% have lost a job, internship, or job offer, and 29\% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours perweek due to COVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides. Lower-income students are 55\% more likely than their higher-income peers to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Finally, we showthat the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach               This is a reflective and forward-thinking piece in which educators are presented as first responders to the crisis. The article is structured in four parts. First, the opportunities and barriers that COVID-19 is encountering in 21st-century education are commented on. Second, there is recognition of the need to be connected more than ever; and the vital role of networks. Third, the article discusses the effort to realize the maxim ``not to leave anyone behind.'' Fourth, the last section summarizes the key points related to the aspects to which education should devote its efforts in the coming months and years in Spain.                                         Findings               There is a set of reasons why the Spanish education system is extremely vulnerable to the consequences caused by COVID-19, and these include, among others: the high rates of socioeconomic segregation, of school dropouts and of academic failure; poor culture of networking and collaboration; overcrowded classrooms that hinders quality education; an obsolete curriculum; the consideration of education as a political currency; the need to strengthen bimodal education; and teachers' obligation to update their digital competences.

  abstract = {Regional haze episodes have occurred frequently in eastern China over the past decades. As a critical indicator to evaluate air quality, the mass concentration of ambient fine particulate matters smaller than 2.5 \textmu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) is involved in many studies. To overcome the limitations of ground measurements on PM2.5 concentration, which is featured in disperse representation and coarse coverage, many statistical models were developed to depict the relationship between ground-level PM2.5 and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, the current satellite-derived AOD products and statistical models on PM2.5\textendash AOD are insufficient to investigate PM2.5 characteristics at the urban scale, in that spatial resolution is crucial to identify the relationship between PM2.5 and anthropogenic activities. This paper presents a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model to generate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations from satellite-derived 500 m AOD. The GTWR model incorporates the SARA (simplified high resolution MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithm) AOD product with meteorological variables, including planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and temperature (TEMP) extracted from WRF (weather research and forecasting) assimilation to depict the spatio-temporal dynamics in the PM2.5\textendash AOD relationship. The estimated ground-level PM2.5 concentration has 500 m resolution at the MODIS satellite's overpass moments twice a day, which can be used for air quality monitoring and haze tracking at the urban and regional scale. To test the performance of the GTWR model, a case study was carried out in a region covering the adjacent parts of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces in central China. A cross validation was done to evaluate the performance of the GTWR model. Compared with OLS, GWR, and TWR models, the GTWR model obtained the highest value of coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest values of mean absolute difference (MAD), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).},

  abstract = {This article discusses general modeling of multisubject and/or multisession FMRI data. In particular, we show that a two-level mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated from parameter and variance estimates from the single-session level) can be made equivalent to a single complete mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated directly from all of the original single sessions' time series data) if the (co-)variance at the second level is set equal to the sum of the (co-)variances in the single-level form, using the BLUE with known covariances. This result has significant implications for group studies in FMRI, since it shows that the group analysis requires only values of the parameter estimates and their (co-)variance from the first level, generalizing the well-established ``summary statistics'' approach in FMRI. The simple and generalized framework allows different prewhitening and different first-level regressors to be used for each subject. The framework incorporates multiple levels and cases such as repeated measures, paired or unpaired t tests and F tests at the group level; explicit examples of such models are given in the article. Using numerical simulations based on typical first-level covariance structures from real FMRI data we demonstrate that by taking into account lower-level covariances and heterogeneity a substantial increase in higher-level Z score is possible.},

Typical approaches perform selection separately on each of the fixed and random effect components. However, changing the structure of one set of effects can lead to different choices of variables for the other set of effects. We propose simultaneous selection of the fixed and random factors in an LME model using a modified Cholesky decomposition. Our method is based on a penalized joint log likelihood with an adaptive penalty for the selection and estimation of both the fixed and random effects. It performs model selection by allowing fixed effects or standard deviations of random effects to be exactly zero. A constrained expectation\textendash maximization algorithm is then used to obtain the final estimates. It is further shown that the proposed penalized estimator enjoys the Oracle property, in that, asymptotically it performs as well as if the true model was known beforehand. We demonstrate the performance of our method based on a simulation study and a real data example.},

  abstract = {Background/Context: The Equality of Educational Opportunity study is widely recognized as one of the most important studies on schooling ever performed. The findings from the report have shaped the field of education, national education policies, and wider public and scholarly opinion regarding the contributions of schools and schooling to equality and productivity in the United States. Despite past reanalyses of the data and decades of research on the effects of schools as organizations, the report's fundamental finding-that a student's family background is far more important than school social composition and school resources for understanding student outcomes-still retains much of its currency. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Using the original Equality of Educational Opportunity data, this study replicated Coleman's statistical models but also applied a two-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) to measure the effects of school-level social composition, resources, teacher characteristics, and peer characteristics on ninth-grade students' verbal achievement. Research Design: HLM allows researchers to disentangle how schools and students' family backgrounds contribute to learning outcomes. The methodology offers a clearer interpretation of the relative effects of school characteristics, including racial/ethnic composition, and family background, including race/ethnicity and social class, on students' academic outcomes. Findings/Results: Our results suggest that schools do indeed matter, in that when one examines the outcomes across the national sample of schools, fully 40\% of the differences in achievement can be found between schools. Even after statistically taking into account students' family background, a large proportion of the variation among true school means is related to differences explained by school characteristics. Within-school inequalities in the achievement outcomes for African American and White students and students from families of higher and lower social class are explained in part by teachers' biases favoring middle-class students and by schools' greater reliance on curriculum differentiation through the use of academic and nonacademic tracking. Conclusions/Recommendations: Formal decomposition of the variance attributable to individual background and the social composition of the schools suggests that going to a high-poverty school or a highly segregated African American school has a profound effect on a student's achievement outcomes, above and beyond the effect of individual poverty or minority status. Specifically, both the racial/ethnic and social class composition of a student's school are 1 3/4 times more important than a student's individual race/ethnicity or social class for understanding educational outcomes.},

In this paper, the analysis is generalized by introducing two contiguity matrices, related to two autocorrelation parameters. This may be useful when dealing with variables representing flows between regions, where both the origin and the destination regions have a different impact on the autocorrelation scheme. It is shown analytically and illustrated empirically that the presence of such autocorrelation can be tested with the likelihood-ratio test, whereas the parameters can be estimated by the maximum-likelihood approach.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes house price data belonging to three hierarchical levels of spatial units. House selling prices with associated individual attributes (the elementary level-1) are grouped within municipalities (level-2), which form districts (level-3), which are themselves nested in counties (level-4). Additionally to individual attributes, explanatory covariates with possibly nonlinear effects are available on two of these spatial resolutions. We apply a multilevel version of structured additive regression (STAR) models to regress house prices on individual attributes and locational neighbourhood characteristics in a four-level hierarchical model. In multilevel STAR models the regression coefficients of a particular nonlinear term may themselves obey a regression model with structured additive predictor. The framework thus allows to incorporate nonlinear covariate effects and time trends, smooth spatial effects and complex interactions at every level of the hierarchy of the multilevel model. Moreover, we are able to decompose the spatial heterogeneity effect and investigate its magnitude at different spatial resolutions allowing for improved predictive quality even in the case of unobserved spatial units. Statistical inference is fully Bayesian and based on highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques that take advantage of the hierarchical structure in the data.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a ``savvy'' prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

Instead it is desirable to use estimators of the mean with minimal bias. Another important conclusion is that the first order difference based estimator that achieves minimax rate of convergence in the one-dimensional case does not do the same in the high dimensional case. Instead, the optimal order of differences depends on the number of dimensions.},

Main outcomes measure               The risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease (all subtypes; all measured in odds ratio), and the degree to which this is mediated through BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour respectively.                                         Results               Each additional standard deviation of education (3.6 years) was associated with a 13\% lower risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.86, 95\% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89) in observational analysis and a 37\% lower risk (0.63, 0.60 to 0.67) in mendelian randomisation analysis. As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15\% (95\% confidence interval 13\% to 17\%) and 18\% (14\% to 23\%) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11\% (9\% to 13\%) and 21\% (15\% to 27\%) for systolic blood pressure and 19\% (15\% to 22\%) and 34\% (17\% to 50\%) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42\% (36\% to 48\%) and 36\% (5\% to 68\%) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease.                                         Conclusions               BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation.},

A hierarchical Bayesian model is used to identify any random effect with zero variance. The proposed approach reparameterizes the mixed model so that functions of the covariance parameters of the random effects distribution are incorporated as regression coefficients on standard normal latent variables. We allow random effects to effectively drop out of the model by choosing mixture priors with point mass at zero for the random effects variances. Due to the reparameterization, the model enjoys a conditionally linear structure that facilitates the use of normal conjugate priors. We demonstrate that posterior computation can proceed via a simple and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The methods are illustrated using simulated data and real data from a study relating prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and psychomotor development of children.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of social media users are becoming used to disseminate activities through geotagged posts. The massive available geotagged posts enable collections of users' footprints over time and offer effective opportunities for mobility prediction. Using geotagged posts for spatio-temporal prediction of future location, however, is challenging. Previous studies either focus on next-place prediction or rely on dense data sources such as GPS data. Introduced in this article is a novel method for future location prediction of individuals based on geotagged social media data. This method employs the hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm with adaptive parameter selection to identify the regions frequently visited by a social media user. A multi-feature weighted Bayesian model is then developed to forecast users' spatio-temporal locations by combining multiple factors affecting human mobility patterns. Further, an updating strategy is designed to efficiently adjust, over time, the proposed model to the dynamics in users' mobility patterns. Based on two real-life datasets, the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art method in prediction accuracy by up to 5.34\% and 3.30\%. Tests show prediction reliability is high with quality predictions, but low in the identification of erroneous locations.},

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a population-based sample of Taiwanese adults (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 25,985) from the 2005 Social Development Trend Survey on Health and Safety was performed. Multilevel models integrated with geographically weighted regressions were employed to analyze the spatially varying association between area disadvantages and obesity. The dependent variable was body mass index calculated from respondents' self-reported weight and height. The key explanatory variable was a township disadvantage index made of poverty level, minority composition, and social disorder. Other individual socio-demographic characteristics were included to account for the compositional effect. Results: The association between township disadvantages and elevated obesity risk in Taiwan was found to be area-specific. In contrast to results from the commonly used global regression, geographically weighted regression model showed that township disadvantages elevated obesity level only in certain areas. Conclusions: We found heterogeneity of place-level determinants of obesity across geographical areas. Adoption of population approach to curb obesity would require area-specific strategies for most needed areas.},

The coarse spatial resolution (0.25{$\smwhtcircle$}) of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product is insufficient for practical requirements. In this paper, a multivariable geographically weighted regression (GWR) downscaling method was developed to obtain 1 km precipitation. The GWR method was compared with two other downscaling methods [univariate regression (UR) and multivariate regression (MR)] in terms of the performance of downscaled annual precipitation. Variables selection procedures were proposed for selecting appropriate auxiliary factors in all three downscaling methods. To obtain the monthly 1 km precipitation, two monthly downscaling strategies (annual-based fraction disaggregation method and monthly based GWR method) were evaluated. All analysis was tested in Gansu province, China with a semiarid to arid climate for three typical years. Validation with measurements from 24 rain gauge stations showed that the proposed GWR method performed consistently better than the UR and MR methods. Two monthly downscaling methods were efficient in deriving the monthly precipitation at 1 km. The former method faces the challenge of precipitation spatial heterogeneity and the derived monthly precipitation heavily depends on the annual downscaled results, which could lead to the accumulation of errors. The monthly based GWR method is suitable for downscaling monthly precipitation, but the accuracy of original TRMM 3B43 data would have large influence on downscaling results. It was demonstrated that the proposed method was effective for obtaining both annual and monthly TRMM 1 km precipitation with high accuracy.},

To achieve transportation sustainability and continued economic development, the dependency on private vehicles must be decreased by increasing public transportation usage. However, without knowing the key factors that affect public transportation usage, developing strategies that effectively improve public transportation usage is impossible. Therefore, this study respectively applies global and local regression models to identify the key factors of usage rates for 348 regions (township or districts) in Taiwan. The global regression model, the Tobit regression model (TRM), is used to estimate one set of parameters that are associated with explanatory variables and explain regional differences in usage rates, while the local regression model, geographically weighted regression (GWR), estimates parameters differently depending on spatial correlations among neighbouring regions. By referencing related studies, 32 potential explanatory variables in four categories, social-economic, land use, public transportation, and private transportation, are chosen. Model performance is compared in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and spatial autocorrelation coefficient (Moran' I). Estimation results show that the GWR model has better prediction accuracy and better accommodation of spatial autocorrelation. Seven variables are significantly tested, and most have parameters that differ across regions in Taiwan. Based on these findings, strategies are proposed that improve public transportation usage.},

Methods: Data on individual sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, and drinking were obtained from Taiwan Social Change Survey conducted in 1990, 1995, and 2000. The overall response rate was 67\%. A total of 5883 women and men aged over 20 living in 434 neighborhoods were interviewed. Participants' addresses were geocoded and linked with Taiwan census data for measuring neighborhood-level characteristics including neighborhood education, neighborhood concentration of elderly people, and neighborhood social disorganization. The data were analyzed with multilevel binomial regression models. Results: Several interaction effects between neighborhood characteristics and individual socioeconomic status (SES) were found in multilevel analyses. Our results indicated that different neighborhood characteristics led to different interaction patterns. For example, neighborhood education had a positive effect on smoking for low SES women, in contrast to a negative effect on smoking for high SES women. This result supports the hypothesis of "relative deprivation," suggesting that poor people living in affluent neighborhoods suffer from relative deprivation and relative standing. On the other hand, neighborhood social disorganization has positive effects on drinking for low SES individuals, but not for high SES individuals. These interactive effects support the hypothesis of the double jeopardy theory, suggesting that living in neighborhoods with high social disorganization will intensify the effects of individual low SES. Conclusion: The findings of this study show new evidence for the effects of neighborhood characteristics on individual smoking and drinking in Taiwan, suggesting that more studies are needed to understand neighborhood effects in Asian societies.},

Using fuzzy c-means clustering first, the spatial heterogeneity (six clusters) in the PM data collected between 2005 and 2009 in Taiwan are identified and the industrial and urban areas of Taiwan (southwestern, west central, northwestern, and northern Taiwan) are found to have high PM concentrations. The PM10-PM2.5 relationship is then modeled with global ordinary least squares regression, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). The GTWR and GWR produce consistent results; however, GTWR provides more detailed information of spatio-temporal variations of the PM10-PM2.5 relationship. The results also show that GTWR provides a relatively high goodness of fit and sufficient space-time explanatory power. In particular, the PM2.5 or PM10 varies with time and space, depending on weather conditions and the spatial distribution of land use and emission patterns in local areas. Such information can be used to determine patterns of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in PM that will allow the control of pollutants and the reduction of public exposure.},

However, it and the measures that can be calculated from it have been criticised for not providing any indication of the spatial distribution of errors. Other research has identified the need for methods to analyse the spatial non-stationarity of error and to visualise the spatial variation in classification uncertainty. This research uses geographically weighted approaches to model the spatial variations in the accuracy of both (crisp) Boolean and (soft) fuzzy land cover classes. Remotely sensed data were classified using a maximum likelihood classifier and a fuzzy classifier to predict Boolean and fuzzy land cover classes respectively. Field data were collected at sub-pixel locations and used to generate soft and crisp validation data. A Geographically Weighted Regression was used to analyse spatial variations in the relationships between observations of Boolean land cover in the field and land cover classified from remote sensing imagery. A geographically weighted difference measure was used to analyse spatial variations in fuzzy land cover accuracy. Maps of the spatial distribution of accuracy were created for fuzzy and Boolean classes. This research demonstrates that data collected as part of a standard remote sensing validation exercise can be used to estimate mapped, spatial distributions of accuracy that would augment standard accuracy measures reported in the error matrix. It suggests that geographically weighted approaches, and the spatially explicit representations of accuracy they support, offer the opportunity to report land cover accuracy in a more informative way.},

  abstract = {Hedonic house-price models have long been used in urban studies to investigate important factors characterizing cities (eg, the demand for amenities or housing submarkets). Traditionally, the formulation of hedonic models has been solved using global spatial econometric techniques. The development of local regression methods brought new insights into urban planning as the relationships between house prices and their determinants can be estimated locally and therefore mapped across space. Such maps provide planners and policy makers with valuable location-specific information to support their decision-making processes. A feature that is frequently overlooked when performing spatial local analysis is testing the statistical significance of local parameter estimates over space. This can be done by mapping the t-value of parameter estimates (t-surfaces). In this study we propose the use of a mixed geographically weighted regression (mixed-GWR) technique to estimate a hedonic house-price model in Zurich. Mixed-GWR is an extended version of GWR by which some parameters are allowed to vary over space, while others remained fixed. To obtain spatially explicit results in a more meaningful way, we propose the use of t-surfaces to explore the statistical significance of selected local parameter estimates over space. We also follow the Bonferroni correction to overcome the problem of multiple hypothesis testing in local regression modelling. Results reveal interesting patterns in the spatial variability of local estimates for planners. For instance, areas are identified over which public policies such as house taxing have little or no effect on house pricing. Similarly, economic distortions in the housing market can be examined through the variability of residents' willingness to pay for larger dwellings. Also, urban development processes such as densification of cities can be supported by spatially exploring relevant socioeconomic variables.},

The motivation is that classic multilevel models are not specifically spatial. Lower level units may be nested into higher level ones based on a geographical hierarchy (or a membership structure--for example, census zones into regions) but the actual locations of the units and the distances between them are not directly considered: what matters is the groupings but not how close together any two units are within those groupings. As a consequence, spatial interaction effects are neither modelled nor measured, confounding group effects (understood as some sort of contextual effect that acts 'top down' upon members of a group) with proximity effects (some sort of joint dependency that emerges between neighbours). To deal with this, we incorporate spatial simultaneous autoregressive processes into both the outcome variable and the higher level residuals. To assess the performance of the proposed method and the classic multilevel model, a series of Monte Carlo simulations are conducted. The results show that the proposed method performs well in retrieving the true model parameters whereas the classic multilevel model provides biased and inefficient parameter estimation in the presence of spatial interactions. An important implication of the study is to be cautious of an apparent neighbourhood effect in terms of both its magnitude and statistical significance if spatial interaction effects at a lower level are suspected. Applying the new approach to a two-level land price data set for Beijing, China, we find significant spatial interactions at both the land parcel and district levels.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal kriging (STK) is recognized as a fundamental spacetime prediction method in geo-statistics. Spatiotemporal regression kriging (STRK), which combines space-time regression with STK of the regression residuals, is widely used in various fields, due to its ability to take into account both the external covariate information and spatiotemporal autocorrelation in the sample data. To handle the spatiotemporal non-stationary relationship in the trend component of STRK, this paper extends conventional STRK to incorporate it with an improved geographically and temporally weighted regression (I-GTWR) model. A new geo-statistical model, named geographically and temporally weighted regression spatiotemporal kriging (GTWR-STK), is proposed based on the decomposition of deterministic trend and stochastic residual components. To assess the efficacy of our method, a case study of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) prediction in the coastal areas of Zhejiang, China, for the years 2002 to 2015 was carried out. The results show that the presented method generated reliable results that outperform the GTWR, geographically and temporally weighted regression kriging (GTWR-K) and spatiotemporal ordinary kriging (STOK) models. In addition, employing the optimal spatiotemporal distance obtained by I-GTWR calibration to fit the spatiotemporal variograms of residual mapping is confirmed to be feasible, and it considerably simplifies the residual estimation of STK interpolation.},

  abstract = {Space-time modelling has been successfully applied in numerous research projects and has been studied extensively in the field of geographical information science. However, the cyclical or seasonal variations in the temporal dimension of most spatiotemporal processes are rarely considered along with spatiotemporal nonstationarity. Seasonal variations are widespread and typical in marine environmental processes, and addressing both spatiotemporal heterogeneity and seasonal variations is particularly difficult in the turbid and optically complex coastal seas. By incorporating seasonal periodic effects into a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model, we proposed a geographically and cycle-temporally weighted regression (GcTWR) model. To test its performance, modelling of chlorophyll-a, known as an important indicator of the coastal environment, is performed using the in situ data collected from 2012 to 2016 in the coastal sea of Zhejiang Province, China. GcTWR is compared with global ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), cycle-temporally weighted regression (cTWR), and GTWR models. In the results, the GcTWR model decreases absolute errors by 89.74\%, 79.77\%, 76.60\% and 29.83\% relative to the OLS, GWR, cTWR, and GTWR models, and presents a higher R2 (0.9274) than the GWR (0.5911), cTWR (0.6465), and GTWR (0.8721) models. The estimation results further confirm that the seasonal influences in coastal areas are much more significant than the interannual effects, which accordingly demonstrates that extending the GTWR model to handle both spatiotemporal heterogeneity and seasonal variations are meaningful. In addition, a novel 3D visualization method is proposed to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the estimation results.},

Housing properties located in Wangsa Maju in the north-east of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was chosen as the case study. The outcome of this study showed a positive relationship between the existence of urban forests and house prices. In other words, the proximity of a property to the nearest urban forests uplifts the expected selling price of a house. More importantly this study reveals that the relationship between house price and urban forest are varied over geographical space. In other words, the relationship between house price and urban forest indicates that locational externalities generated by urban forests have a positive impact on house price in some areas but negative or no impact on the others. The magnitude of the effect was also found to be varied; the capitalisation in house prices is found greater in some areas but less on the others. The use of GWR allows such spatially varying relationships to be revealed, therefore leading to a better understanding of the relationship between the existence of urban forests and house prices. Moreover, the positive relationship between the existence of urban forests and house prices found in this study was the reason for urban forests to be preserved and future developments that may involve these precious resources need to be well planned.},

  abstract = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the R2 statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model R2 statistic for the linear mixed model by using only a single model. The proposed R2 statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The R2 statistic arises as a 1\textendash 1 function of an appropriate F statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model with a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the R2 statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial R2 statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives a very small p-value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure (BP) compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme p-value, a very small R2, a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated BP outcomes for the study.

As far as the countries in the period of market transition are concerned, with the maturity of the market and thegrowth of economy, the impact of education expansion on the returns to education will pass three periods:the risingperiod, the period of no significant impact, and the falling period.

  abstract = {The adverse effects caused by PM2.5 have drawn extensive concern and it is of great significance to identify its spatial distribution. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used for PM2.5 estimation. However, the coarse spatial resolution and the gaps caused by data deficiency impede its better application at the urban scale. Additionally, obtaining accurate results in unsampled spatial areas when PM2.5 ground sites are insufficient and distribute sparsely is also a challenging issue for PM2.5 spatial distribution estimation. This paper aimed to develop a model, i.e., spatially local extreme gradient boosting (SL-XGB), combining the powerful fitting ability of machine learning and optimal bandwidths of local models, to better estimate PM2.5 concentration at the urban scale by using Beijing as the study area. This paper adopted simplified high-resolution MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithm (SARA) AOD at 500 m resolution as the major independent variable, hence, ensuring the estimation can be operated at a fine scale. Moreover, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was adopted to fill the gaps in SARA AOD, thus improving its availability. Then, based on full-covered SARA AOD and other multisource data, the SL-XGB model, integrating multiple local XGBoost models and particular optimal bandwidths, was trained to estimate PM2.5 concentration. For comparison, SL-XGB and two other models, XGBoost and geographically weighted regression (GWR), were evaluated by 10-fold cross validation (CV). The sample-based CV results reveal that the SL-XGB performed the best as assessed through R2 (0.88), root mean square error (RMSE = 24.08 {$\mu$}g/m3) and mean prediction error (MPE = 16.90 {$\mu$}g/m3). Additionally, SL-XGB also performed the best in the site-based CV with a R2 of 0.86, a RMSE of 26.15 {$\mu$}g/m3 and a MPE of 17.97 {$\mu$}g/m3, which shows its good spatial generalization ability. These results demonstrate that SL-XGB can better simultaneously handle non-linear and spatial heterogeneity issues despite spatially limited data at the urban scale. As far as the PM2.5 concentration distribution was concerned, it presented a gradient increase in PM2.5 concentrations from the northwest to the southeast in Beijing, with abundant spatial details. Overall, the proposed approach for PM2.5 estimation showed outstanding performance and can support preventive pollution control and mitigation at the urban scale.},

To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a simple and powerful two-step alternative is proposed.

Methods for estimating standard deviations of estimated coef\textregistered cient functions are also proposed. Some asymptotic results for the local polynomial estimators are established. Two longitudinal data sets, one of which involves time-dependent covariates, are used to demonstrate the approach proposed. Simulation studies show that our two-step approach improves the kernel method proposed by Hoover and co-workers in several aspects such as accuracy, computational time and visual appeal of the estimators.},

  abstract = {Hedonic price modelling has long been a powerful tool to estimate house prices in the real estate market. Increasingly, traditional global hedonic price models that largely ignore spatial effects are being superseded by models that deal with spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity. In addition, many novel methods integrating spatial economics, statistics and geographical information science (GIScience) have been developed recently to incorporate temporal effects into hedonic house price modelling. Here, a local spatial modelling technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR), which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in housing utility functions is applied to a 19-year set of house price data in London (1980\textendash 1998) in order to explore spatiotemporal variations in the determinants of house prices. Further, based on the local parameter estimates derived from GWR, a new method integrating GWR and time series (TS) forecasting techniques, GWR\textendash TS, is proposed to predict future local parameters and thus future house prices. The results obtained from GWR demonstrate variations in local parameter estimates over both space and time. The forecasted future values of local estimates as well as house prices indicate that the proposed GWR\textendash TS method is a useful addition to hedonic price modelling.},

In the western region, the increase in cultivated land and reduction of residential land cause GDP growth, and the effects of unused land is still uncertain. Among them, the efficiency of residential land contributes the growth most, followed by cultivated land, finally, unused land. From 2000 to 2007, the importance of cultivated land decreases gradually and the role in promoting the economy is also weakened. The scale utility of residential land gradually increases.},

  abstract = {Customary spatial modeling with point-referenced data introduces a modeling specification that includes a mean term, a spatial error or random effects term and a pure error term. The spatial random effects are usually modeled through a mean zero spatial process. If the mean term includes an intercept, then the spatial random effects can be interpreted as local spatial adjustments to the intercept. If the mean term is a familiar linear regression then it makes sense to ask whether the regression coefficients are constant or whether they might vary spatially, analogous to the intercept. This has been previously considered and the benefits of the increased flexibility have been demonstrated. The situation with replicates available at spatial locations is considered. This enables the building of the spatial analog of a multilevel model\textemdash replicate level covariates to explain the replicate level responses and location level covariates to explain the location level coefficients. The particular motivation for this modeling effort is a data set on condominium sales in Singapore. In this case, the replicates are the sales of condominiums within a building. Unit level features are available to explain the selling price of the unit and building level attributes to explain the coefficients. Anticipating dependence between coefficients, a multivariate spatial process specification is provided. This process is specified through kernel convolutions due to the computational challenges associated with fitting such models to a fairly large data set. There is flexibility in this kernel modeling necessitating model comparison. In particular, roughly 68,000 transactions across 1374 buildings (locations) are analyzed and the results and interpretation for the selected model are presented.},

In this study, the spatial statistical model, coupled with GIS as well as GWR model, is developed. The proposed model is validated using the house price data in Shenzhen, China, when considering these factors such as the land price, transportation, the distance to the commercial center, the distance to hospital, school, the house type, the brand of the house etc. It is demonstrated that our approach provides an effective model to present the distribution of the residential house price and serve as a tool for house price appraisal during the property tax levy process.},

The SD-GTWR model, which integrates the analysis and relationship of seasonal difference, spatial and temporal characteristics of HFRS (HFRS was characterized by spatiotemporal heterogeneity and it is seasonally distributed), was designed to illustrate the latent relationships between the spatio-temporal pattern of the HFRS epidemic and its influencing factors.

The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where localized models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. Currently, GWmodel includes functions for: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW regression, and GW discriminant analysis; some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Equality in access to dental services, independent of level of education, is an important aim of Scandinavian welfare policy. In Norway, this policy is the main justification for a dental public subsidy scheme for adults. An important part of the subsidy scheme is to cover the cost of fixed prosthodontic treatment, including implant-based crowns and bridges for premolars, canines and incisors. A stated policy goal is to secure equal access to everybody in need of these services, independent of their level of education. The aim of this study was to estimate the causal effect of education on the probability of receiving fixed prosthodontic treatment in the adult Norwegian population. METHODS: During the period 1960-1972, all municipalities in Norway were required to increase the number of compulsory years of education from seven to nine years. We used this education reform as the instrumental variable to create exogenous variation in the individual's number of years of education. The education data were combined with data from the Norwegian Health Economics Administration, which contained our outcome variable. Our sample included individuals with 9 years education or less. Altogether 113 237 individuals were included in the study. RESULTS: For men, the first stage regression coefficient was 0.87 (confidence interval: 0.82-0.92). This means that the reform resulted in 0.87 additional years of education. For men, the probability of receiving fixed prosthodontic treatment increased by 0.67 percentage points per additional year of schooling. For women, the first stage regression coefficient was 0.84 (confidence interval: 0.79-0.88). The second stage regression coefficient was small (= 0.0022) and not statistically significant at a conventional level. CONCLUSION: From a welfare policy point of view, for men, the subsidy scheme has not succeeded to redistribute resources so that dental services are accessible independent of their social status.},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is closely related to the air quality and public health. Numerous models have been introduced to simulate the PM2.5 concentrations at large scale based on remote sensing and auxiliary data. However, the data precision provided by these models are inadequate for epidemiology and pollutant exposure studies at medium or small scale. The present study aims to calibrate PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km resolution scale across China during 2015\textendash 2018 based on monitoring station data and auxiliary data using a novel geographically and temporally weighted regression model (GTWR). The cross-validation (CV) method and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model are conducted for validation and cross-comparison. Additionally, the spatial autocorrelation and slope analysis methods are implemented to detect the spatiotemporal dynamic of PM2.5 concentrations. A sample-based CV of the GTWR model demonstrates an acceptable precision with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.67, a root-mean-square error of 10.32 {$\mu$}g/m3, and a mean prediction error of-6.56 {$\mu$}g/ m3. This result proves that the GTWR model can simulate PM2.5 concentrations at a higher spatial resolution and accuracy across China than some previous models. Besides, the heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dynamic of PM2.5 concentrations are obvious, that is, the High-High (H-H) agglomeration areas with strong haze pollution were mainly concentrated in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Chengdu-Chongqing (CY), and Guanzhong Plain (GZP). In addition, the PM2.5 concentrations are undergoing a decreasing trend in most of the study area, and the decrease in the BTH is dramatic. The results of the present study are helpful for calibrating and detecting the spatiotemporal dynamic of PM2.5 concentrations and useful for the government to make decisions about decreasing haze pollution in urban agglomeration scale.},

This study analyzes differences in declines in learning gains in primary education in the Netherlands for reading, spelling and math, using rich data on standardized test scores and register data on student and parental background for almost 300,000 unique students. The results show large inequalities in the learning loss based on parental education and parental income, on top of already existing inequalities.

  abstract = {This paper explores neighbourhood-level correlates of the Covid-19 deaths in London during the initial rise and peak of the pandemic within the UK - the period March 1 to April 17, 2020. It asks whether the person-level predictors of Covid-19 that are identified in reports by Public Health England and by the Office of National Statistics also hold at a neighbourhood scale, remaining evident in the differences between neighbours. In examining this, the paper focuses on localised differences in the number of deaths, putting forward an innovative method of analysis that looks at the differences between places that share a border. Specifically, a difference across spatial boundaries method is employed to consider whether a higher number of deaths in one neighbourhood, when compared to its neighbours, is related to other differences between those contiguous locations. It is also used to map localised 'hot spots' and to look for spatial variation in the regression coefficients. The results are compared to those for a later period, April 18 - May 31. The findings show that despite some spatial diffusion of the disease, a greater number of deaths continues to be associated with Asian and Black ethnic groups, socio-economic disadvantage, very large households (likely indicative of residential overcrowding), and fewer from younger age groups. The analysis adds to the evidence showing that age, wealth/deprivation, and ethnicity are key risk factors associated with higher mortality rates from Covid-19.},

Results indicated that cattle prices produced under extensive production systems were influenced by all of predictor categories, confirming that found previously. Although many of the agro-ecological predictors were inherently spatial in nature, the incorporation of spatial effects into the estimation of the hedonic model itself, through either a spatially-autocorrelated error term or allowing the regression coefficients to vary spatially and at different scales, was able to provide greater insight into the cattle price process. Through the latter extension, using a multiscale geographically weighted regression, which was the most informative and most accurate model, relationships between cattle price and predictors operated at a mixture of global, regional, local and highly local spatial scales. This result is considered a key advance, where uncovering, interpreting, and utilizing such rich spatial information can help improve the geographical provenance of Uruguayan beef and is critically important for maintaining Uruguay's status as a key exporter of beef with respect to the health and safety benefits of natural, open-sky, grass-fed production systems.},

It argues that assessment of educational resources and measures such as school enrolment and educational achievement are limited in what they tell us about the injustices learners may experience. It is proposed that, drawing on Amartya Sen's capability approach, we benefit from extending our evaluative space beyond learners' achievements to encompass their freedoms to achieve. It is argued that attention should be paid to the relative value individuals place on these various freedoms. Furthermore, in order to deepen insights into the multiple factors influencing the development of learner values, and the unequal possibilities for realising their aspired valued achievements, the discussion also draws on key sociological concepts from Pierre Bourdieu. The theoretical synthesis leads to the introduction of the Sen-Bourdieu Analytical Framework, a conceptual model that illustrates the socially dynamic processes within which learners and formal educational systems are situated. The principal aims are to offer an alternative development paradigm and an expanded evaluative framework to inform local, national and international educational policy and practice.},

We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form E fjXj by a sum of smooth functions E sj(Xj). The sj(.)'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor q = E fjXj is replaced by the additive predictor E sj(Xj); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

Single-family-home prices in Austria are explored to investigate the capability of global and locally weighted hedonic models. Even if regional indicators are not fully capable to model SH and technical amendments are required to account for unmodelled SH, the results emphasise their importance to achieve a well-specified model. Due to SH beyond the level of regional indicators, locally weighted regressions are proposed. Mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) prevents the limitations of fixed effects by exploring spatially stationary and non-stationary price effects. Besides reducing prediction errors, it is concluded that global model misspecifications arise from improper selected fixed effects. Reported findings provide evidence that the SH of implicit prices is more complex than can be modelled by regional indicators or purely local models. The existence of both stationary and non-stationary effects implies that the Austrian housing market is economically connected.},

A multilevel problem is a problem that inquires into the relationships between a set of variables that are measured at a number of different levels of a hierarchy. This article discusses some traditional approaches to the analysis of multilevel data and their statistical shortcomings. The random coefficient linear model is presented, which resolves many of these problems, and the currently available software is discussed. Next, some more general developments in multilevel modeling are discussed. The authors end with an overview of this special issue.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between the built environment and the risk of COVID-19 transmission is essential to respond to the pandemic. This study explores the relationship between the built environment and COVID-19 risk using the confirmed cases data collected in Hong Kong. Using the information on the residential buildings and places visited for each case from the dataset, we assess the risk of COVID-19 and explore their geographic patterns at the level of Tertiary Planning Unit (TPU) based on incidence rate (R1) and venue density (R2). We then investigate the associations between several built-environment variables (e.g., nodal accessibility and green space density) and COVID-19 risk using global Poisson regression (GPR) and geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) models. The results indicate that COVID-19 risk tends to be concentrated in particular areas of Hong Kong. Using the incidence rate as an indicator to assess COVID-19 risk may underestimate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in some suburban areas. The GPR and GWPR models suggest a close and spatially heterogeneous relationship between the selected built-environment variables and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The study provides useful insights that support policymakers in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics.},

  abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is important for exploring data relationships between real estate price and its influential factors. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) technique has been frequently adopted for this purpose. In this study, we collected a second-hand real estate house price data set of Wuhan, in which each property is located the same as the community it belongs to. Thus, this data set possesses a typical characteristic, that is, dozens or even hundreds of observations could be allocated to one pair of coordinates, but vary in their attributes. This specific feature might lead to serious problems with bandwidth optimisations and coefficient estimates for calibrating the GWR model. We then proposed an extension by combining the hierarchical linear model (HLM) and GWR, namely HLM-GWR to cope with these problems. Results show that the HLM-GWR performs much better than the conventional GWR and HLM technique in terms of bandwidth optimisation, coefficient estimates. With a controlled simulation test, we again validated the advantage of the HLM-GWR model in comparison to both the HLM and GWR in handling this specific scenario. Overall, HLM-GWR is workable and should be recommended in this case or other scenarios with observations of similar spatial distributions.},

GWR has many application in practice as a visualization and prediction tool for spatial exploration (e.g in climate, economy, medical). However, this locally regression model is slow in process upon the volume of calculations and the spatial getting bigger. Improving performance of GWR is a critical issue, but their distributed implementations have not been studied. Recently, with the advent of Spark as well MapReduce framework, the development of machine learning applications and parallel programming becomes easier. In this article, we propose several large-scale implementations of distributed GWR, leveraging Spark framework. We implemented and evaluated these approaches with large datasets. To our best knowledge, this is the first work addressing GWR at large-scale.},

A model selection criterion, called the ICQ statistic, is proposed for selecting the penalty parameters (Ibrahim, Zhu, and Tang, 2008, Journal of the American Statistical Association 103, 1648\textendash 1658). The variable selection procedure based on ICQ is shown to consistently select important fixed and random effects.

Simulation studies and a real data set from a Yale infant growth study are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

Schools and education of children should undergo an extensive digital transformation to be able to meet the needs of the young generation and their digitalized future. The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly and abruptly forced schools and education indeed to engage in such a transformation. In this study we examine the digital transformation initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the basic education of the young generation, the variety of digital divides emerging and reinforced, and the possible barriers reported along the way. We argue that information management research should better acknowledge children, their digitalized everyday life and their basic education as significant areas of concern. We should understand them as well as allow them to shape the education we offer in the context of higher education, but we should also aim at influencing the basic education of the young generation - for the purpose of equipping them with important skills and competencies for their digital futures but also for the purpose of arousing their interest in this important field, maybe even as a career option.},

In this study, we have attempted to model areas with humans at risk of dengue fever prevalence, depending on the spatial relationship between dengue fever cases and different socioeconomic parameters. We have developed new methods to verify the quality of neighborhoods from high resolution satellite images based on several factors such as density of houses in each neighborhood in each district, width of streets, and roof area of houses. In the absence of detailed neighborhood quality information being available for each district, we felt this factor would best approximate the reality on the ground at local scales. Socioeconomic parameters, such as population numbers, population density, and neighborhood quality were analyzed using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to create a prediction model identifying levels of risk of dengue and to describe the association between DF cases and the related socio-economic factors. Descriptive analysis was used to characterize dengue fever victims among Saudis and non-Saudis in various age groups. The results show that there was a strong positive association between dengue fever cases and socioeconomic factors (R{$^2$} = 0.80). The prevalence among Saudis was higher compared to non-Saudis in 2006 and 2007, while the prevalence among non-Saudis was higher in 2008, 2009 and 2010. For age groups, DF was more prevalent in adults between the ages of 16 and 60, accounting for approximately 74\% of all reported cases in 2006, 67\% in 2007, 81\% in 2008, 87\% in 2009, and 81\% in 2010.},

In this article, we develop a methodology for generalizing this model to accommodate geographically hierarchical data. This article considers two-level hierarchical structures and allow for the coefficients of both low-level and high-level units to vary over space. We assume that the spatially varying low-level coefficients follow the multivariate Gaussian process, and the spatially varying high-level coefficients follow the multivariate simultaneous autoregressive model that we develop by extending the standard simultaneous autoregressive model to incorporate multivariate data. We apply the proposed model to transaction data of houses sold in 2014 in a part of the city of Los Angeles. The results show that the proposed model predicts housing prices and fits the data effectively.},

A fully Bayesian variable selection is implemented using a stochastic search Gibbs sampler to estimate the exact model-averaged posterior distribution. This approach automatically identifies subsets of predictors having nonzero fixed effect coefficients or nonzero random effects variance, while allowing uncertainty in the model selection process. Default priors are proposed for the variance components and an efficient parameter expansion Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation. The approach is illustrated using simulated data and an epidemiologic example.},

We applied a classical ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression \-together with a geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explain long-term wildfire occurrence patterns (mean annual density of {$>$}1 ha fires). The explanatory power of the OLS model increased from 52\% to 78\% as a result of the non-constant relationships between fire occurrence and the underlying explanatory variables throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The global model we developed (i.e., OLS regression) was not sufficient to fully describe the underlying causal factors in wildfire occurrence modeling. Indeed, local approaches (i.e., GWR) can complement the global model in overcoming the problem of non-stationarity or missing variables. Our results confirm the importance of agrarian activities, land abandonment, and development processes as underlying factors of fire occurrence. The identification of regions with spatially varying relationships can contribute to the better understanding of the fire problem, especially over large geographic areas, while at the same time recognizing its local character. This can be very important for fire management and policy.},

Data were collected in April 2020, approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69\% mothers and 31\% fathers) with at least one child 0-12 years of age. The majority were White (71\%) and 41\% had at least a bachelor's degree. The majority of parents (78\%) were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1\%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7\%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0\%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9\%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B =-0.16, 95\% CI = [-0.29,-0.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B =-0.37, 95\% CI = [-0.47,-0.27], p \textexclamdown{} .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = 0.17, 95\% CI = [0.06, 0.28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = 0.40, 95\% CI = [0.32, 0.48], p \textexclamdown{} .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation. Overall, study results suggested that parents' mental health may be an important factor linked to at-home education and child wellbeing during the pandemic.},

Some appropriate statistics for testing the goodness of fit of the GWR model and for testing variation of the parameters in the model are proposed and their approximated distributions are investigated. The work makes it possible to test spatial nonstationarity in a conventional statistical manner. To substantiate the theoretical arguments, some simulations are run to examine the power of the statistics for exploring spatial nonstationarity and the results are encouraging. To streamline the model, a stepwise procedure for choosing important independent variables is also formulated. In the last section, a prediction problem based on the GWR model is studied, and a confidence interval for the true value of the dependent variable at a new location is also established. The study paves the path for formal analysis of spatial nonstationarity on the basis of the GWR model.},

In this line of research, many spatial data sets have been successfully analyzed and some statistical tests for spatial variation have been developed. However, an important assumption in these studies is that the disturbance terms of the GWR model are uncorrelated and of common variance. Similar to the case in the ordinary linear regression, spatial autocorrelation can invalidate the standard assumption of homoscedasticity of the disturbances and mislead the results of statistical inference. Therefore, developing some statistical methods to test for spatial autocorrelation is a very important issue. In this paper, two kinds of the statistical tests for spatial autocorrelation among the residuals of the GWR model are suggested. Also, an efficient approximation method for calculating the p-values of the test statistics is proposed. Some simulations are run to examine the performances of the proposed methods and the results are encouraging. The study not only makes it possible to test for spatial autocorrelation among the GWR residuals in a conventional statistical manner, but also provides a useful means for model validation.},

  abstract = {As a much finer particle, particulate matter less than 1 {$\mu$}m (PM1) plays an important role on the haze formation and human health. However, the capability of mapping PM1 concentration is severely impaired by coarse temporal resolution and low estimation accuracy, largely due to the neglect of spatial or temporal autocorre\- lation of PM1. In order to improve the estimation of high-resolution PM1, here we developed a novel spatio\- temporal model named extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using Himawari-8 aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological factors, and geographical covariates. The estimation of PM1 over Zhejiang province showed that XGBoost-GTWR method was characterized by greater predictive ability (10-fold cross-validation R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.83, root mean squared error (RMSE) {$\frac{1}{4}$} 10.72 {$\mu$}g/m3) compared with other 11 models. Additionally, the extrapolation test was performed to validate the robustness of the hybrid model and the result demonstrated that XGBoost-GTWR can accurately predict the out-of-band PM1 concen\- tration (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.75 (0.60), RMSE {$\frac{1}{4}$} 12.71 (12.58) {$\mu$}g/m3). The PM1 concentration displayed pronounced spatial heterogeneity, with the highest value in Quzhou (34.72 \dbend{} 1.77 {$\mu$}g/m3) and the lowest in Zhoushan (26.39 \dbend{} 1.56 {$\mu$}g/m3), respectively. In terms of the seasonality, the highest PM1 concentration was observed in winter (39.06 \dbend{} 3.08 {$\mu$}g/m3), followed by those in spring (32.54 \dbend{} 3.09 {$\mu$}g/m3) and autumn (30.97 \dbend{} 4.50 {$\mu$}g/m3), and the lowest one in summer (25.57 \dbend{} 5.22 {$\mu$}g/m3). The high aerosol emission and adverse meteorological con\- ditions (e.g., low boundary layer height and lack of precipitation) were key factors accounting for the peak PM1 concentration observed in winter. Also, the PM1 concentration exhibited significant diurnal variation, peaking at 1500 local solar time (LST) but reaching the lowest value at 1000 LST. This method enhances our capability of estimating hourly PM1 from space, and lays a solid data foundation for improving the assessment of the fine particle-related health effect.},

GWR computes location-specific parameter estimates, which makes its calibration process computationally intensive.

In the era of big data, this places a severe limitation on the use of GWR. To overcome this limitation, we propose a highly scalable, open-source FastGWR implementation based on Python and the Message Passing Interface (MPI) that scales to the order of millions of observations. FastGWR optimizes memory usage along with parallelization to boost performance significantly. To illustrate the performance of FastGWR, a hedonic house price model is calibrated on approximately 1.3 million single-family residential properties from a Zillow dataset for the city of Los Angeles, which is the first effort to apply GWR to a dataset of this size. The results show that FastGWR scales linearly as the number of cores within the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment increases. It also outperforms currently available open-sourced GWR software packages with drastic speed reductions \textendash{} up to thousands of times faster \textendash{} on a standard desktop.},

  abstract = {Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) has been broadly used in various fields to model spatially non-stationary relationships. Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) is a recent advancement to the classic GWR model. MGWR is superior in capturing multi-scale processes over the traditional single-scale GWR model by using different bandwidths for each covariate. However, the multiscale property of MGWR brings additional computation costs. The calibration process of MGWR involves iterative back-fitting under the additive model (AM) framework. Currently, MGWR can only be applied on small datasets within a tolerable time and is prohibitively timeconsuming to run with moderately large datasets (greater than 5,000 observations). In this paper, we propose a parallel implementation that has crucial computational improvements to the MGWR calibration. This improved computational method reduces both memory footprint and runtime to allow MGWR modelling to be applied to moderate-to-large datasets (up to 100,000 observations). These improvements are integrated into the mgwr python package and the MGWR 2.0 software, both of which are freely available to download.},

However, the GWR model often considers spatial nonstationarity and does not address variations in local temporal issues. Therefore, this paper explores a geographically temporal weighted regression (GTWR) approach that accounts for both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously to estimate house prices based on travel time distance metrics. Using house price data collected between 1980 and 2016, the house price response and explanatory variables are then modeled using both the GWR and the GTWR approaches. Comparing the GWR model with Euclidean and travel distance metrics, the GTWR model with travel distance obtains the highest value for the coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest values for the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The results show that the GTWR model provides a relatively high goodness of fit and sufficient space-time explanatory power with non-Euclidean distance metrics. The results of this study can be used to formulate more effective policies for real estate management.},

Residents are willing to pay a premium for better air quality and the influence of air quality is partially reflected in housing prices, which indicates that better air quality has been becoming a scarce resource with the improvement of people's living standard. Furthermore, the impacts of haze on housing prices are also expected to lead to a ``crowding out effect'' in different regions. This would be detrimental for human capital accumulation and will accelerate the regional divergence in the internal economy and population structure, thus forming a region ``fence'' within cities.},

  abstract = {To capture both global stationarity and spatiotemporal non-stationarity, a novel mixed geographically and temporally weighted regression (MGTWR) model accounting for global and local effects in both space and time is presented. Since the constant and spatial-temporal varying coefficients could not be estimated in one step, a two-stage least squares estimation is introduced to calibrate the model. Both simulations and real-world datasets are used to test and verify the performance of the proposed MGTWR model. Additionally, an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is adopted as a key model fitting diagnostic. The experiments demonstrate that the MGTWR model yields more accurate results than do traditional spatially weighted regression models. For instance, the MGTWR model decreased AIC value by 2.7066, 36.368 and 112.812 with respect to those of the mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model and by 45.5628, -38.774 and 35.656 with respect to those of the geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) model for the three simulation datasets. Moreover, compared to the MGWR and GTWR models, the MGTWR model obtained the lowest AIC value and mean square error (MSE) and the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj). In addition, our experiments proved the existence of both global stationarity and spatiotemporal non-stationarity, as well as the practical ability of the proposed method.},

Based on the Weibo help data, we inferred the spatial distribution pattern of the epidemic situation and its impacts. Seven urban factors, i.e., urban growth, general hospital, commercial facilities, subway station, land-use mixture, aging ratio, and road density, were selected for validation with the ordinary linear model, in which the former six factors presented a globally significant association with epidemic severity. Then, the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) was adopted to identify their unevenly distributed effects in the urban space. Among the six factors, the distribution and density of major hospitals exerted significant effects on epidemic situation. Commercial facilities appear to be the most prevalently distributed significant factor on epidemic situation over the city. Urban growth, in particular the newly developed residential quarters with high-rise buildings around the waterfront area of Hanyang and Wuchang, face greater risk of the distribution. The influence of subway stations concentrates at the adjacency place where the three towns meet and some near-terminal locations. The aging ratio of the community dominantly affects the hinterland of Hankou to a broader extent than other areas in the city. Upon discovering the result, a series of managerial implications that coordinate various urban factors were proposed. This research may contribute toward developing specific planning and design responses for different areas in the city based on a better understanding of the occurrence, transmission, and diffusion of the COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan area.},

This research applied a local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model using four land use area variables (high-density urban use, low-density urban use, cropland, and forest) for population estimation in the city of Atlanta, Georgia at the census tract level, and found that the four-class local GWR model could help improve the accuracy of population estimation over a four-class global OLS model by 28\%. The spatial non-stationarity seemed to be affected by the core-periphery locations in the city. This research also confirmed that a regional regression approach based on census tracts aggregated by counties could minimize spatial non-stationarity, and produced more accurate population estimation than that for the study area as a whole using the global OLS model, thus pointing to a way to improve population estimation using the traditional global model. The GWR model also identified the parts of the city where spatial non-stationarity is least influential, and as a result, a global OLS model could be used for population estimation.},

Substantial "evidence" has been collected to establish superior performance of modern plug-in methods in comparison to methods such as cross validation: this has ranged from detailed analysis of rates of convergence, to simulations, to superior performance on real datasets. In this work we take a detailed look at some of this evidence, looking into the sources of differences. Our findings challenge the claimed superiority of plug-in methods on several fronts. First, plug-in methods are heavily dependent on arbitrary specification of pilot bandwidths and fail when this specification is wrong. Second, the often-quoted variability and undersmoothing of cross validation simply reflects the uncertainty of bandwidth selection; plug-in methods reflect this uncertainty by oversmoothing and missing important features when given difficult problems. Third, we look at asymptotic theory. Plug-in methods use available curvature information in an inefficient manner, resulting in inefficient estimates. Previous comparisons with classical approaches penalized the classical approaches for this inefficiency Asymptotically, the plug-in based estimates are beaten by their own pilot estimates.},

How to choose or define such a distance metric is key, and in this respect, a `Minkowski approach' is proposed that enables the selection of an optimum distance metric for a given GWR model. This approach is evaluated within a simulation experiment consisting of three scenarios. The results are twofold: (1) a well-chosen distance metric can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of a GWR model; and (2) the approach allows a good approximation of the underlying `optimal distance metric', which is considered useful when the `true' distance metric is unknown.},

Within the advancement of technology regarding the geostatistical dataset, this study uses a field strength model to quantify policy-oriented factors and designs a modified logistic regression model to analyze the main drivers of urban expansion by selecting natural environment, socioeconomic development, and especially policy-oriented variables. Wuhan City in central China is taken as an example: the modified model is applied and compared with the classical model, and the driving mechanism of urban expansion in Wuhan from 2006 to 2013 is determined through spatial analysis. The results show that the urban system planning in combination with various anthropologic and environmental factors can be comprehensively quantified and described by the urban field strength. The methodological innovation of the classical logistic regression model is tested by statistical and spatial analysis methods, and the results verify that the modified regression model can be used more accurately to investigate the driving mechanism of urban expansion in the past and simulate the spatial pattern of urban evolution in the future.},

Using a robust conception of `equality of condition', we examine key dimensions of equality that are central to both the purposes and processes of education: equality in educational and related resources; equality of respect and recognition; equality of power; and equality of love, care and solidarity. We indicate in each case some of the major changes that need to occur if we are to promote equality of condition. Starting with inequalities of resources, and in particular with inequalities tied to social class, we argue for abandoning rigid grouping policies, challenging the power of parents in relation to both selection and grouping, and changing curricula and assessment systems to make them more inclusive of the wide range of human intelligences. In relation to respect and recognition, we call for much more inclusive processes for respecting differences, not only in schools' organizational cultures, but also in their curriculum, pedagogy and assessment systems. Regarding inequalities of power, we call for democratization of both teacher-student relationships and school and college organization. For promoting equality of love, care and solidarity, we argue that schools need to develop an appreciation of the intrinsic role that emotions play in the process of teaching and learning, to provide a space for students and teachers to talk about their feelings and concerns, and to devise educational experiences that will enable students to develop their emotional skills or personal intelligences as a discrete area of human capability.},

However, studies outside North America have been limited due to the lack of ground PM2.5 measurements to calibrate the model. Taking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we developed a national-scale geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in China with fused satellite AOD as the primary predictor. The results showed that the meteorological and land use information can greatly improve model performance. The overall cross-validation (CV) R2 is 0.64 and root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) is 32.98 {$\mu$}g/m3. The mean prediction error (MPE) of the predicted annual PM2.5 is 8.28 {$\mu$}g/m3. Our predicted annual PM2.5 concentrations indicated that over 96\% of the Chinese population lives in areas that exceed the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (CNAAQS) Level 2 standard. Our results also confirmed satellite-derived AOD in conjunction with meteorological fields and land use information can be successfully applied to extend the ground PM2.5 monitoring network in China.},

  abstract = {Understanding the influence of the built environment on transit ridership can provide transit authorities with insightful information for operation management and policy making, and ultimately, increase the attractiveness of public transportation. Existing studies have resorted to either traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression or geographically weighted regression (GWR) to unravel the complex relationship between ridership and the built environment. Time is a critical dimension that traditional GWR cannot recognize well when performing spatiotemporal analysis on transit ridership. This study addressed this issue by introducing temporal variation into traditional GWR and leveraging geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) to explore the spatiotemporal influence of the built environment on transit ridership. An empirical study conducted in Beijing using one-month transit smart card and point-of-interest data at the traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level demonstrated the effectiveness of GTWR. Compared with those of the traditional OLS and GWR models, a significantly better goodness-of-fit was observed for GTWR. Moreover, the spatiotemporal pattern of coefficients was further analyzed in several TAZs with typical land use types, thereby highlighting the importance of temporal features in spatiotemporal data. Transit authorities can develop transit planning and traffic demand management policies with improved accuracy by utilizing the enhanced precision and spatiotemporal modeling of GTWR to alleviate urban traffic problems.},

It is a useful statistical modelling tool in a number of areas of spatial data analysis. After an MGWR model is identified and calibrated, which has been well studied recently, one of the important inference problems is to evaluate the influence of the explanatory variables in the constant-coefficient part on the response of the model. This is useful in the selection of the variables and for the purpose of explanation. In this paper, a statistical inference framework for this issue is suggested and, besides the F-approximation, which has been frequently used in the literature of the geographically weighted regression technique, a bootstrap procedure for deriving the p-value of the test is also suggested. The performance of the test is investigated by extensive simulations. It is demonstrated that both the F-approximation and the bootstrap procedure work satisfactorily.},

In view of some shortcomings of the existing inferential methods, we propose a residual-based bootstrap test to detect the constant coefficients in a GWR model. The proposed test is free of the assumption that the model error term is normally distributed and admits some useful extensions for identifying more complicated spatial patterns of the coefficients. Some simulation with comparison to the existing test methods is conducted to assess the test performance, including the accuracy of the bootstrap approximation to the null distribution of the test statistic, the power in identifying spatially varying coefficients and the robustness to collinearity among the explanatory variables. The simulation results demonstrate that the bootstrap test works quite well. Furthermore, a real-world data set is analyzed to illustrate the application of the proposed test.},

The results indicate that older persons' and couples' living arrangement decisions are responsive to housing affordability in that those who live in areas with high housing costs experience increased likelihoods of living with nonnuclear adults. For married couples, housing availability is also associated with living arrangement decisions, and for single men and women, the relative share of the housing market composed of small rental units is positively associated with residential independence. In addition, housing availability and affordability are positively associated with the likelihood of living alone as compared to living in group quarters or an institution.},

Using the crime occurrence dataset of snatch-and-run offences in Kyoto City from 2003 to 2004, we confirm that the proposed methodology enables simultaneous visualisation of the geographical extent and duration of crime clusters, by which stable and transient space-time crime clusters can be intuitively differentiated. Also, the combined use of the two statistical techniques revealed temporal inter-cluster associations showing that transient clusters alternatively appeared in a pair of hotspot regions, suggesting a new type of ``displacement'' phenomenon of crime. Highlighting the complementary aspects of the two space-time statistical approaches, we conclude that combining these approaches in a space-time cube display is particularly valuable for a spatio-temporal exploratory data analysis of clusters to extract new knowledge of crime epidemiology from a data set of spacetime crime events.},

Moreover, GWR model provides a better specification to model rather than Ordinary Least Square Regression (OLS). It can be easily applied to spatial data by using the R packages that are available in R programming or GWR4 software. Though, the statistical test studies for GWR infrequently explored due to its complexity problem. Currently, the GWR studies are only limited for exploration on the relationship between the variables in study field. While the validation process for hypothesis testing of GWR model is difficult to conduct due to multiple parameter estimations for each location. The main purpose of this paper is to summaries a statistical inferences analysis for GWR model. The hypothesis testing will be derived by testing the variation of the parameter in the model.

  abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a spatial statistical technique that recognizes that traditional `global' regression models may be limited when spatial processes vary with spatial context. GWR captures process spatial heterogeneity by allowing effects to vary over space. To do this, GWR calibrates an ensemble of local linear models at any number of locations using `borrowed' nearby data. This provides a surface of location-specific parameter estimates for each relationship in the model that is allowed to vary spatially, as well as a single bandwidth parameter that provides intuition about the geographic scale of the processes. A recent extension to this framework allows each relationship to vary according to a distinct spatial scale parameter, and is therefore known as multiscale (M)GWR. This paper introduces mgwr, a Python-based implementation of MGWR that explicitly focuses on the multiscale analysis of spatial heterogeneity. It provides novel functionality for inference and exploratory analysis of local spatial processes, new diagnostics unique to multi-scale local models, and drastic improvements to efficiency in estimation routines. We provide two case studies using mgwr, in addition to reviewing core concepts of local models. We present this in a literate programming style, providing an overview of the primary software functionality and demonstrations of suggested usage alongside the discussion of primary concepts and demonstration of the improvements made in mgwr.},

The causes of obesity can vary but are often complex and multifactorial, and while many contributing factors can be targeted for intervention, an understanding of where these interventions are needed is necessary in order to implement effective policy. This has prompted an interest in incorporating spatial context into the analysis and modeling of obesity determinants, especially through the use of geographically weighted regression (GWR).                                         Method               This paper provides a critical review of previous GWR models of obesogenic processes and then presents a novel application of multiscale (M)GWR using the Phoenix metropolitan area as a case study.                                         Results                                Though the MGWR model consumes more degrees of freedom than OLS, it consumes far fewer degrees of freedom than GWR, ultimately resulting in a more nuanced analysis that can incorporate spatial context but does not force every relationship to become local                 a priori                 . In addition, MGWR yields a lower AIC and AICc value than GWR and is also less prone to issues of multicollinearity. Consequently, MGWR is able to improve our understanding of the factors that influence obesity rates by providing determinant-specific spatial contexts.                                                        Conclusion               The results show that a mix of global and local processes are able to best model obesity rates and that MGWR provides a richer yet more parsimonious quantitative representation of obesity rate determinants compared to both GWR and ordinary least squares.},

It also serves as an essential thread in the fabric of many other physical and social sciences, which has contributed to the use of different terminology for similar manifestations of what we refer to as `scale', leading to a surprising amount of diversity around this fundamental concept and its various `multiscale' extensions. To address this, we review common abstractions about spatial scale and how they are employed in quantitative research. We also explore areas where the conceptualizations of multiple spatial scales can be differentiated. This is achieved by first bridging terminology and concepts, and then conducting a scoping review of the topic. A typology for spatial scale is discussed that can be used to categorize its multifarious meanings and measures. This typology is then used to distinguish what we term `process scale,' from other types of spatial scale and to highlight current trends in uncovering aspects of process scale. We end with suggestions on how to further build knowledge regarding spatial processes through the lens of spatial scale.},

  abstract = {Most research into the role of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of obesity has taken environment to mean behaviours such as exercise and diet. While interesting, this is somewhat at odds with research into the social determinants of obesity, in which the focus has shifted away from individuals and behaviours to the types of wider obesogenic environments in which individuals live, which influence and produce these behaviours. This study combines these two strands of research by investigating how the genetic influence on body mass index (BMI), used as a proxy for obesity, changes across different neighbourhood environments measured by levels of deprivation. Genetics are incorporated using a classical twin design with data from Twins UK, a longitudinal study of UK twins running since 1992. A multilevel modelling approach is taken to decompose variation between individuals into genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components. Neighbourhood deprivation is found to be a statistically significant predictor of BMI after conditioning on individual characteristics, and a heritability of 0.75 is estimated for the entire sample. This heritability estimate is shown, however, to be higher in more deprived neighbourhoods and lower in less deprived ones, and this relationship is statistically significant. While this research cannot say anything directly about the mechanisms behind the relationship, it does highlight how the relative importance of genetic factors can vary across different social environments, and therefore the value of considering both genetic and social determinants of health simultaneously.},

Closures of schools, institutions and other learning spaces have impacted more than 94\% of the world's student population. This has brought far-reaching changes in all aspects of our lives. Social distancing and restrictive movement policies have significantly disturbed traditional educational practices. Reopening of schools after relaxation of restriction is another challenge with many new standard operating procedures put in place.             Within a short span of the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have shared their works on teaching and learning in different ways. Several schools, colleges and universities have discontinued face-to-face teachings. There is a fear of losing 2020 academic year or even more in the coming future. The need of the hour is to innovate and implement alternative educational system and assessment strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with an opportunity to pave the way for introducing digital learning.

Drawing on recent academic literature and a theoretical understanding of the role of technology in education, this article examines whether MOOCs can indeed reduce global inequality in education. The paper concludes that while MOOCs can provide a novel form of learning through technology and remove a significant cost barrier to education, they will do little to reduce global educational gaps until they are able to reach and retain those most lacking education.},

Measuring socioeconomic development, especially the changes to education inequality, can help educators, practitioners, and policymakers with decision- and policy-making. This article presents an approach that combines population distribution, human settlements, and nighttime light (NTL) data to assess and explore development and education inequality trajectories at national levels across multiple time periods using latent growth models (LGMs). Results show that countries and regions with initially low human development levels tend to have higher levels of associated education inequality and uneven distribution of urban population. Additionally, the initial status of human development can be used to explain the linear growth rate of education inequality, but the association between trajectories becomes less significant as time increases.},

We build on this theory of social reproduction by extending it to better understand how digital technology use is implicated in this process of unequal resource allocation in schools. We contend that educational resources, like digital technologies, are also sorted by schools. Drawing on scholarship from both education research and science and technology studies, we show how educational institutions have long played a role in constructing the value of technologies to different ends, by constructing hierarchies of technological activity, like ``vocational'' and ``academic'' computer use, even when strikingly similar. We then apply this lens to three areas of inquiry in education research: the use of digital technologies for instruction, school use of student data, and college admissions. Each illustrates how education scholars can view technologies as part of school sorting processes and with implications for inequality within and beyond the classroom.},

Various important results regarding the use of distance education were obtained during the pandemic period and yielded significant findings. The first and the most important finding is that theachers have difficulties in internet access and lack of infrastructure, classroom management and human resources. Another challenge that participants reported was about teachers' and students' behaviours. The last theme stated by the participants is the distance education process itself. The findings reveal that the participants determined their strategies to deal with these problems with new arrangements regarding the classroom management, getting help from colleagues, family members and experts and communicating with students and parents. It can be certainly suggested that the participants are not ready for the distance education process and there is a lack of application in this regard; such as technology support and distance education training, and moreover, the participants do not have sufficient knowledge and experience about distance education.},

Moreover, there is currently no global forest map that is consistent with forest statistics from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). By combining these diverse data sources into a single forest cover product, it is possible to produce a global forest map that is more accurate than the individual input layers and to produce a map that is consistent with FAO statistics. In this paper we applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) to integrate eight different forest products into three global hybrid forest cover maps at a 1 km resolution for the reference year 2000. Input products included global land cover and forest maps at varying resolutions from 30 m to 1 km, mosaics of regional land use/land cover products where available, and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product. The GWR was trained using crowdsourced data collected via the Geo-Wiki platform and the hybrid maps were then validated using an independent dataset collected via the same system. Three different hybrid maps were produced: two consistent with FAO statistics, one at the country and one at the regional level, and a ``best guess'' forest cover map that is independent of FAO. Independent validation showed that the ``best guess'' hybrid product had the best overall accuracy of 93\% when compared with the individual input datasets. The global hybrid forest cover maps are available at http://biomass.geo-wiki.org.},

In particular, many ensemble methods have been proposed to deal with such imbalance. However, most efforts so far are only focused on two-class imbalance problems. There are unsolved issues in multiclass imbalance problems, which exist in real-world applications. This paper studies the challenges posed by the multiclass imbalance problems and investigates the generalization ability of some ensemble solutions, including our recently proposed algorithm AdaBoost.NC, with the aim of handling multiclass and imbalance effectively and directly. We first study the impact of multiminority and multimajority on the performance of two basic resampling techniques. They both present strong negative effects. "Multimajority" tends to be more harmful to the generalization performance. Motivated by the results, we then apply AdaBoost.NC to several real-world multiclass imbalance tasks and compare it to other popular ensemble methods. AdaBoost.NC is shown to be better at recognizing minority class examples and balancing the performance among classes in terms of G-mean without using any class decomposition.},

  abstract = {Variation in the spatial heterogeneity of points reflects the evolutionary process or mechanism of geographical events. The key to depicting this variation is quantifying spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, the spatial heterogeneity of a point pattern is defined as the degree of aggregation-type deviation from complete spatial randomness. In such a case, a goodness-of-fit-type statistic based on the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances called the level of heterogeneity (LH*) is regarded as a standard measurement, and a normalized version called the normalized level of heterogeneity (NLH*) is proposed for datasets with different point numbers and study region areas. Considering the complex integration calculation of LH* and NLH*, simulation experiments are implemented to test the capability of some classic nearest-neighbor statistics in quantifying spatial heterogeneity. The results showed that except for the standard LH* statistic, only Clark and Evans' statistic (A-w) and Byth and Ripley's statistic (H-xw) are robust. Statistics NLH*, (A-w) and (H-xw) are validated by quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of two-dimensional crime events, threedimensional earthquake events and four-dimensional origindestination (OD) events. The results indicate that these statistics all have a reasonable explanation in quantifying spatial heterogeneity for real-world geographical events of different types and with different dimensions. Compared with NLH*, Clark and Evans' (A-w) statistic and Byth and Ripley's (H-xw) statistic are recommended from the perspective of accessibility.},

  abstract = {Bodies have been claimed to be an `absent presence' and touch `risky business' in physical education (PE). We have now witnessed how these claims are intensified in pandemic times of Covid-19, particularly in countries that have adopted extreme lockdown measures. This paper explores how PE practices have become `touchless' and bodies absent using the theoretical concepts of risk and assemblage. The paper focusses on a group of pre-service PE teachers who were keen on undertaking their PE practicum experience and who were forced to switch to online mode. Data were collected through participant-produced drawings and comments on the drawings. Results suggest that the pre-service teachers are experiencing a mix of emotions during this time, miss the physical contact with students and believe the subject of PE is losing its identity as a consequence of the current situation. The conclusions of this study reveal a shift in the way that bodies are being constituted as assemblages now, and the possibility that pre-service teachers are missing out on an important aspect of their practicum experiences because of the lack of direct contact with students. We also wonder if pre-service teacher education programmes should put more emphasis on better preparing the students to teach online, and what will be the long-term consequences in the teaching of PE because of the current Covid-19 pandemic situation.},

We discuss the identification and estimation of these models and use simulations to study the role of exclusion restrictions in minimizing the dependence of inferences on unverifiable parametric assumptions.

Children of immigrants underperform their counterparts with native-born parents in vocabulary tests, particularly if a language other than the official language is spoken at home, but are not generally disadvantaged in nonverbal cognitive domains, nor are there notable behavioral differences. These findings suggest that the cross-country differences in cognitive outcomes during the teen years documented in the existing literature are much less evident during the early years.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) has become a popular criterion for model selection in recent years. The BIC is intended to provide a measure of the weight of evidence favoring one model over another, or Bayes factor. It has, however, some important drawbacks that are not widely recognized. First, Bayes factors depend on prior beliefs about the expected distribution of parameter values, and there is no guarantee that the Bayes factor implied by the BIC will be close to one calculated from a prior distribution that an observer would actually regard as appropriate. Second, to obtain the Bayes factors that follow from the BIC, investigators would have to vary their prior distributions depending on the marginal distributions of the variables and the nature of the hypothesis. Such variations seem unwarranted in principle and tend to make the BIC inclined to favor excessively simple models in practice. These points are illustrated by the analysis of several examples, and alternatives to use of the BIC are discussed.},

In the first part of this research we compare the geographically weighted regression with a linear regression estimated using OLS with spatial variables. In the second part, we combine the geographically weighted regression with the penalized spline regression to extract the effect of time on prices. With this method we obtain a nonlinear and more precise measure of time effects and improved goodness-of-fit statistics. We obtain a hedonic index, that is more robust against short-term changes in house prices than the usual, linear hedonic index. This is a novel approach, which has not been applied before in the case of the Polish housing market. The index allows us to show how interest rates or the housing policy influenced house prices.},

Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local regression method that can achieve the spatial extension of dependent variables based on the relationships between the dependent variables and environment variables and the spatial distances between the sample points and predicted locations. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of GWR in predicting soil salinity because the existing interpolation methods for soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta are still of low precision. Additionally, multiple linear regressions, cokriging and regression kriging were added to compare the accuracy of GWRs. The results showed that GWR predicted soil salinity with high accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracy was improved when compared to other methods. The root mean square error, correlation coefficient, regression coefficient and adjustment coefficients between the observed values and predicted values of the validation points were 0.31, 0.65, 0.57 and 0.42, respectively, which were better than that of other methods, indicating that GWR is an optimal method.},

Then, MGTWR is employed to explore spatiotemporal variations and how influential factors are associated with housing prices in Shenzhen. This article attempts to extend GTWR to MGTWR in consideration of scale effects, thereby highlighting the importance of different levels of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Furthermore, the empirical results of this study can provide valuable policy implications for real estate development in areas where urban planning should address multiscale effects in both temporal and spatial dimensions.},

After reviewing 15 published pieces of literature, we noticed that in recent years, the nature of education inequality in China has shifted from gender to geographics (differences in coastal/inland regions) and eventually to urban-rural inequality. We investigated the most recent data on urban-rural education inequality to analyze - based on a timeline, the phenomenons occurring in the Chinese education systems. From such analysis, we would then provide our policy recommendations. At last, we give our policy recommendations regarding China's formation mechanisms, arguing for regional teaching systems, increasing government spending on education, and an assessment system for urban and rural teaching quality.},

Remote sensing information (the fraction of soil and impervious surface that represent degraded neighborhood environmental conditions) is added to fine-tune the relationship. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach is used to investigate spatial non-stationarity. The modeling revealed that significant spatial non-stationarity existed between house values and the predictors. Specifically, the study found that those house attributes\textemdash including floor size, number of bathrooms, air conditioners, and fireplaces\textemdash add more value to houses in the more affluent areas (especially on the east side near Lake Michigan and in suburban areas) than in the relatively poor areas. In addition, older houses in the historical area are more expensive, which differs from other areas. Environmental conditions, though expected to have a negative impact on house values in most areas, did not affect house values in the historical area.},

Using a panel data of 285 prefecture-level cities in China and based on the evaluation of green development by a Driving-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model, this paper analyzes the spatial correlation of financial agglomeration on green development. The paper also investigates the differences in the spatio-temporal influence of financial agglomeration on green development from both global and local perspectives by employing a Bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (BLISA) model and a Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model. The results indicate that: (1) There exists significant spatial dependency between financial agglomeration and green development from 2003 to 2015, with Low-Low (L-L) and Low-High (L-H) spatial clusters as the main cluster types. (2) From the local perspective, the promoting effect of financial agglomerations on green development has showed significant spatial heterogeneity with a gradually decreasing trend from the southeast coast to the northwest inland of China. This work can help to develop policies for supporting green development by formulating differential strategies for financial agglomerations.},

  abstract = {In order to better understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems, the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and atmospheric constituents have been explored widely by scientists using the global technique of Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) regression analysis. However, recent studies exploring such relationships at different spatial scales have revealed that local statistical approaches are more appropriate when the assumption of spatial stationarity is invalid. This study aims to explore the relationships between NDVI and the local level atmospheric constituents consisting of precipitation and temperature in the state of Minnesota from 1990 to 1997 using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and spatial interpolation techniques. The analysis focuses on the summer months, when such relationships are more apparent in northern mid-latitude regions. In comparison to traditional OLS, there is a substantial improvement in the analysis using GWR with the average r2 value improved from 0.24 to 0.67. The overall relationship between the different atmospheric constituents and NDVI were broadly consistent with the different types of land uses across the state with the highest correlation located in forested areas. The spatial patterns of the association between different climatic variables and NDVI in the form of regression coefficients were not very consistent over the years as result of inter-annual variations in the local climate.},

  abstract = {We propose a new approach, CCRBoost, to identify the hierarchical structure of spatio-temporal patterns at different resolution levels and subsequently construct a predictive model based on the identified structure. To accomplish this, we first obtain indicators within different spatio-temporal spaces from the raw data. A distributed spatio-temporal pattern (DSTP) is extracted from a distribution, which consists of the locations with similar indicators from the same time period, generated by multi-clustering. Next, we use a greedy searching and pruning algorithm to combine the DSTPs in order to form an ensemble spatio-temporal pattern (ESTP). An ESTP can represent the spatio-temporal pattern of various regularities or a non-stationary pattern. To consider all the possible scenarios of a real-world ST pattern, we then build a model with layers of weighted ESTPs. By evaluating all the indicators of one location, this model can predict whether a target event will occur at this location. In the case study of predicting crime events, our results indicate that the predictive model can achieve 80 percent accuracy in predicting residential burglary, which is better than other methods.},

  abstract = {Current methods of spatial prediction are based on either the First Law of Geography or the statistical principle or the combination of these two. The Second Law of Geography contributes to the revision of these methods so they are adaptive to local conditions but at the cost of increasing demand for samples. This paper presents a new thinking about spatial prediction based on the Third Law of Geography which focuses on the similarity of geographic configuration of locations. Under the Third Law of Geography, spatial prediction can be made on the basis of the similarity of geographic configurations between a sample and a prediction point. This allows the representativeness of a single sample to be used in prediction. A case study in predicting spatial variation of soil organic matter content was used to compare the spatial prediction based the Third Law of Geography with those based on the First Law and the statistical principle. It is concluded that spatial prediction based on the Third Law of Geography does not require samples to be over certain size nor to be of a particular spatial distribution to achieve a high quality prediction. The prediction uncertainty associated with spatial prediction based on the Third Law of Geography is more indicative to quality of the prediction, thus more effective in allocating error reduction efforts. These properties make spatial prediction based on the Third Law of Geography more suitable for prediction over large and complex geographic areas.},
